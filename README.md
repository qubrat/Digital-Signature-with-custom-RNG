# Signing file and verifying signature using RSA encrypting with asymmetric keys

This program allows selecting any file from your system and performing digital signing, and it's verification. \
First, file has to be chosen. Right after opening, a hash is found using SHA-256 hashing.

This enables button `Sign chosen file`, which perform signing of selected file. Before clicking on the button you can select whether you want to automatically download video file or select one from your system. Source of online video is YouTube 24/7 livestream found at [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3MuIUNCCzI).

**Note:** Getting video from the web takes additional time and due to source characteristics and has higher risk of failure during key generation. 

During the process of signing selected file, three files are created - `private.pem`, `public.pem` and `signature.pem`. First two of them are respectively, private and public key. Last one contains signature.

To verify file, first you have to use `Select a signature file` button. Window will open asking you to select a file with signature. This enables `Verify a signature` button. When clicked, program will ask you to select file you want to verify. Then SHA-256 hash of given file is found and verification is performed using public key stored in `public.pem`.  

# Basic setup instructions
Note: It is highly recommended to run program in virtual environment to ensure proper functioning. But you can also follow
steps below.

Using terminal:

1. Install required packages using `pip3`:
```
pip3 install pycryptodome imageio streamlink tk m3u8 urllib3 wave numpy opencv-python moviepy
```
2. Navigate to folder with cloned repository.
3. Run program:
```
py signature.py
```
# Setup in virtual environment
Running program inside virtual environment ensures that it does not mess your other python packages.
If you want to run the program inside virtual environment follow these steps:
1. Make sure virtualenv is installed. If not use:
```
py -m pip install --user virtualenv
```
2. Create virtual environment:
```
py -m venv <venv location and name>
```
3. Activate the venv:
```
.\path\to\venv\Scripts\activate
```
4. You can confirm youâ€™re in the virtual environment by checking the location of your Python interpreter:
```
where python
```

5. Install required packages using `pip3`:
```
pip3 install pycryptodome imageio streamlink tk m3u8 urllib3 wave numpy opencv-python moviepy
```
If you encounter problem with permission of some packages, try running above command with `--no-cache-dir` option.

6. Run program:
- Use terminal:
```
py signature.py
```
- Or simply double-click on `signature.py`.

If you want to switch projects or otherwise leave your virtual environment, simply run:
```
deactivate
```
